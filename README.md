# Simple-Shell

A simple, minimalistic implementation of a shell based on a tutorial using the C language.

Implemented the shell using the 'getline()' function in <stdio.h> to read a line of input instead of using malloc() and realloc() with buffer size. 

getline() expands the block of memory as needed.
