# Simple-Shell

A simple, minimalistic implementation of a shell based on a tutorial using the C language.


Implemented the shell using the 'getline()' function in <stdio.h> instead of using malloc() and realloc() when necessary gets cumberosme, whereas
getline() expands the block of memory as needed.
